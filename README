This Project serves as documentation/demo for using the Wellion CALLA (Premium)
blood glucose meter as a compact general purpose portable developement platform.

Documentation regarding the PCB, schematics and needed datasheets can be found in /doc .

The Wellion Calla features:

-full-color OLED display with SSD1353U4 (Displaycontroller) 160x132 pixel (active area 35mmx28mm)
-Texas Instruments TI MSP430 CPU (MSP430FG4619) 16-Bit RISC
-fully battery powered (two AAA-Cells)
-3V Supply-Voltage
-Ultra-low power consumption
-direct mini-USB Interface
-RTC (Real-time-clock)
-NTC temperature sensor
-integrated high precision reference, ADC/DAC and Instrumentation AMP
-external serial flash memory (Winbond 25x40avnig)

So, where to get one?

-eBay (~ 1-10 EUR)
-Pharmacy (~ 19 EUR)

Look out, there are several similar looking models w/o color-OLED like the "light".
I don't even know if these are "compatible". Likely they have different CPU's.

If you are dependent on your Wellion blood glucose meter, you should never open the device or try

This project is NO enhancement for your Wellion meter nor will it EVER be able to measure blood glucose!!
So far, you've been warned!
